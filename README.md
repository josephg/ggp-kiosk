This is the ggp.org kiosk [client-side game server](http://www.ggp.org/kiosk) written by Sam Schreiber.

The client was extracted from [code.google.com/p/ggp-galaxy](https://code.google.com/p/ggp-galaxy/source/browse/#svn%2Ftrunk%2Fggp-website%2Fwar%2Fkiosk). Its published under the [New BSD License](http://opensource.org/licenses/BSD-3-Clause).

To use XHR, the public/ directory needs to be loaded in a browser via http (not file://), so I've added a simple nodejs express server. Host using whatever.
